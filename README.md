This repo is for my final project as part of Ironhack Bootcamp. It is a website for reviewing business relationships. I was inspired after lending an ear to many entrepreneurial friends and hearing their stories of woe about clients who had screwed them over and almost put them out of business. It seemed only natural that there should be a place where you can share your experiences with clients, and hopefully provide others with the information needed to either reject a bad client or use the leverage of knowledge to their advantage.
